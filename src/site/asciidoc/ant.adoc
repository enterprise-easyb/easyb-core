== Ant

You can run your behaviors and stories via easyb's Ant task. It's easy:

[source]
----
load the task (via Ant's taskdef)-- the class name is io.easyb.ant.BehaviorRunnerTask
provide a location for a report (or series of reports) and then provide a fileset with the location(s) of your behaviors and stories
----

Defining the task looks like this:

[source]
----
  <taskdef name="easyb" classname="io.easyb.ant.BehaviorRunnerTask">
    <classpath>
      <pathelement location="${lib.dir}/release/easyb-xx.jar"/>
    </classpath>
  </taskdef>
----

Running the task looks like:

[source]
----
<easyb>
  <classpath>
     <path refid="build.classpath" />
     <pathelement path="target/classes" />
  </classpath>
 <report location="target/story.txt" format="txtstory" />
 <behaviors dir="${mybehaviors.dir}">
   <include name="**/*Story.groovy"/>
 </behaviors>
</easyb>
----

The easyb task takes a number of options including:

[source]
----
failureFile -- path to file which will contain any failed behaviors
noExecute -- boolean, which allows you to generate a report without executing any stories
tags -- a single or comma-delimited list of tags to execute
----

Please note, report's have numerous formats, including html, xml, txtstory, and txtspecification.

Produces output:

[source]
----
    [easyb] Running story listener story (StoryListener.story)
    [easyb] Scenarios run: 2, Failures: 0, Pending: 0, Time Elapsed: 0.06 sec
    [easyb] 2 total behaviors run with no failures
    [easyb] easyb execution passed

  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 3 seconds
----

=== Failures

The point of having your behaviors run as part of your build is to notify you when they catch possible code problems. easyb also allows a user specified property to be set to true if the build fails.

This property is called failureProperty and using it would look like this

[source]
----
  <easyb failureProperty="easyb.failed">
----

That alone doesn't fail the build but puts the flexibility in your hands to fail it, print it or do nothing with it as you please. Here is a common example of using that property to fail a build:

[source]
----
  <fail if="easyb.failed" message="Execution halted as behaviors failed"/>
----

Now when a behavior fails our build will halt with output like so:

[source]
----
[easyb] easyb is preparing to process 1 file(s)
[easyb] 9 behavior steps run , but status is failure! Total failures: 1
[easyb]   Failure -> then the dealer should win in BlackjackStory.groovy
[easyb]   VerificationException: expected lossss but was loss:
....
....
[easyb] specification failures detected!
[easyb] easyb execution FAILED

BUILD FAILED
/blah/blah/build.xml:75: easyb reported a failure

Total time: 3 seconds
----

Now you can be more confident that your build hasn't been broken by a change since you get instant feedback on behavior failures.

=== Story Printing

easyb embraces the idea that stories are a link between the business requirements and your code. To help use those stories when talking to your clients about requirements, easyb provides a way to print out just the stories without a lot of geeky code.

To print out a story report via Ant, simply create a report element with its format attribute set to txtstory as follows:

[source]
----
<report location="target/stories.txt" format="txtstory"/>
----

Here is some sample output:

[source]
----
9 behavior steps executed successfully  
 Story: blackjack
  scenario tie game when cards are dealt but dealer gets higher card
    given a game a blackjack game and both players have a score of 10
    when the dealer gets an Ace and you get a 10
    then the dealer should win
  scenario tie game when cards are dealt but player gets higher card
    given a game a blackjack game and both players have a score of 10
    when the dealer gets a 10 and you get an Ace
    then the player should win

That looks like something business users (or management) could understandâ€“ they might even be able to _gasp_ write them!
