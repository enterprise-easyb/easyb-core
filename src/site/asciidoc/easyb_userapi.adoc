= Extending easyb

easyb can be extended in two ways. The plugin mechanism provides hooks into the behavior lifecycle processing. Data
parsers provide new ways of injecting data into your where AND example clauses.

Both extension points are based on the Java Service Provider Interface.

== Plugins

== Sources of Data

The way that data is processed in the where clause depends on plugins and two plugins are added by default to the end
of the list of plugins defined for dealing with where data. These deal with a map or a closure - both examples are shown
above. The syntax for these plugins will be changing to deal with Gherkin. The current interface that needs to be
implemented is:

.Groovy Example
[source,java]
----
public interface ExampleDataParser {
    /**
     * processData if the data is of a type that this plugin should parse, then
     * it needs to decode it, calling the closure for each iteration with a map
     * containing fields and values to add to the binding. The parser can add new elements
     * to the binding for the duration of its operation, but must remove them (for consistency)
     * on completion. The StoryProcessing will take care of removing the excess properties
     * in the binding that occur because of these plugins.
     *
     * @param data - the data object passed in the Story
     * @param closure - a closure that we can iterate over for each record. It expects one parameter { map -> }
     * @param binding - the current binding
     *
     * @return true if we processed it, false if not
     */
     boolean processData(data, closure, binding);
}
