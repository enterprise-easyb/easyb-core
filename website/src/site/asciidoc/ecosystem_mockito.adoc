= Mockito

:toc: preamble
Mockito is a slick mocking framework that works just fine w/easyb

The question of whether or not one can use mocking frameworks in easyb arises from time to time. The answer is a
resounding "YES!" -- pretty much anything you can do in normal Java/JUnit, you can do in easyb! Watch!

Using Mockito's own examples, you can use both stories and specifications to mock objects. Here are a few easyb and
mockito examples:

[source,easyb]
----
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*

scenario "stubbing in mockito works", {
    given "a mocked object", {
        mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class)
    }
    when "it is stubbed", {
        when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first")
        when(mockedList.get(1)).thenThrow(new RuntimeException())
    }
    then "verifications should work", {
        mockedList.get(0).shouldBe "first"
        ensureThrows(RuntimeException) {
            mockedList.get(1)
        }
        mockedList.get(9).shouldBe null
    }
}
----

You can use the same example in specs too:

[source,easyb]
----
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*

mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class)

it "should support stubbing method calls", {
    when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first")
    when(mockedList.get(1)).thenThrow(new RuntimeException())
}

it "should behave like a mocked list" , {
    mockedList.get(0).shouldBe "first"
    ensureThrows(RuntimeException){
        mockedList.get(1)
    }
    mockedList.get(9).shouldBe null
}
----

You can also do normal verifications, etc:

[source,easyb]
----
description "mockito should work w/easyb"

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*

mockedList = mock(List.class)

it "should support normal usage of methods", {
    mockedList.add("one")
    mockedList.clear()
}

it "should also support normal verification", {
    verify(mockedList).add("one")
    verify(mockedList).clear()
}
