== Personas

We should introduce the concept of personas into easyb. Ideally they would be not only a
documentation-level construct but also a data object that can be injected into the behaviors. Likely should have
some form of inheritance

== Features

Other BDD frameworks have features. Do we need that in easyb?

== Behaviors

easyb has specifications (unit tests) and stories (acceptance tests). The original easyb-junit component also has
behaviors. Is there a role for a third extension to segment stories in some way?
