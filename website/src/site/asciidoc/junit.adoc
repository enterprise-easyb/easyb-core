The easyb JUnit runner provides a way to run easyb behaviors through JUnit. As of easyb 2.0, the JUnit runner is
more closely integrated into the core easyb project. Since JUnit is widely used testing framework, the easyb JUnit
runner makes it easy to integrate your easyb behaviors into many other tools.

== How It Works

The easyb JUnit runner works by providing a bridge between the standard JUnit Tests and Suites and your easyb
stories and specifications. 

To use the easyb JUnit runner you just need to create a class that extends the io.easyb.junit.EasybSuite abstract class.

See Table 1 for the methods you can override in your subclass to change the way your behaviors
are located and run:

.io.easyb.junit.EasybSuite methods
|===
|method |description

|baseDir
|the base directory the Easyb behaviors are in

|generateReports
|a boolean indicating whether or not easyb should generate html and text execution reports

|reportsDir
|the parent directory containing the report directories

|searchDir
|

|description
|a description for the suite

|trackTime
|whether or not to track execution time. See below.

|===

.Sample Junit Test Suite
[source,java]
----
public class EasybTest extends EasybSuite { 
    @Override 
    protected File baseDir() { 
        return new File("spec"); 
    }

    @Override 
    protected String description() { 
        return "My Project Behaviors"; 
    } 
}
----

Then you can run this test in your IDE, or using Ant, or whatever else and it should execute all the behaviors under
the folder you specified (behaviors must have a file extension of 'specification' or 'story').

== Time Tracking

Because of the way easyb and JUnit work, the tests have to actually run before the JUnit execution actually begins.
Which means that JUnit can't actually track the execution time of the behaviors. The EasybSuite can simulate this if
you tell it to by overriding the trackTime() method. This will increase the runtime of the test, however. These times
will not be totally accurate, but should give a decent idea of execution time. If you do not override this method,
then all the execution times will be 0.

Here's what it looks like with that method overriden: 

[source,java]
----
public class EasybTest extends EasybSuite { 
    @Override 
    protected File baseDir() { 
        return new File("spec"); 
    }

    @Override 
    protected String description() { 
        return "My Project Behaviors"; 
    }

    @Override 
    protected boolean trackTime() { 
        return true; 
    } 
}
----

== Integration with Maven Surefire and Failsafe

The Maven Surefire and Failsafe plugins are the standard way of running unit and integration tests in Maven. By default,
these plugins look for JUnit and/or TestNG tests. You can use the easyb JUnit runner to easily integrate easyb behaviors
into the maven lifecycle with the standard Surefire and Failsafe behavior. For instance, -DskipTests and -DskipITs will
work as expected.

TIP: The easyb-maven-plugin can be used to attach easyb execution to any lifecycle phase but you don't get the expected
Surefire and Failsafe behavior.

=== Surefire Test Names

Surefire is used to execute the unit tests as part of the test lifecyle. By default, the JUnit Surefire
provider will execute tests matching the following patterns:

[source]
----
**/*Test.java
**/Test*.java
**/*TestCase.java
----

The easiest way (that is, without needing to configure the Failsafe plugin) is to create a JUnit test case that extends
io.easyb.junit.EasybSuite in src/test/java and named according to the above patterns. You can then use the properties
of your test case class to define how easyb locates and executes your behaviors.

See http://maven.apache.org/surefire-archives/surefire-2.19.1/maven-surefire-plugin/index.html[http://maven.apache.org/surefire-archives/surefire-2.19.1/maven-surefire-plugin/index.html]

=== Failsafe Test Names

Failsafe is used to execute the integration tests as part of the verify lifecyle. By default, the JUnit Failsafe
provider will execute tests matching the following patterns:

[source]
----
**/*IT.java
**/IT*.java
**/*ITCase.java
----

The easiest way (that is, without needing to configure the Failsafe plugin) is to create a JUnit test case that extends
io.easyb.junit.EasybSuite in src/test/java and named according to the above patterns. You can then use the properties
of your test case class to define how easyb locates and executes your behaviors.
